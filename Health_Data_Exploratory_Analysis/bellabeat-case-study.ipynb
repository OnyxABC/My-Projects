    "### Scenario\n",
    "You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused\n",
    "products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the\n",
    "global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart\n",

    "#### Dataset\n",
    "FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius); A public data that explores smart device users’ daily habits.\n",
    "This data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty (30) fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of\n",
    "personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes\n",
    "information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits. \n",
    "A third-party data service provider called Fitabase LLC (San Diego, California), aggregated the self-tracker data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data set is cited as:  \n",
    "Furberg, R., Brinton, J., Keating, M., & Ortiz, A. (2016).\n",
    "Crowd-sourced Fitbit datasets 03.12.2016-05.12.2016 [Data set].\n",
    "Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.53894\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations of the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The specific population sampled may not be generalizable to other populations. However, this population is familiar with the online environment and therefore may be more adept at performing tasks with technology, thus making feasibility of the protocol administration more likely to be successful.  \n",
    "2. Individuals who can afford and use Fitbit devices are more likely to be younger (between the ages of 18 and 34 years) and affluent, thus impacting generalizability.  \n",
    "3. The data was generated in 2016. This might limit reflections that would be useful in current time.  \n",

    "The Bellabeat company has built its moat (i.e. competitive advantage) by developing technology and services that focuses on women's health & well-being.\n",
    "It is therefore important that continuous upgrades and expansion be adopted to accommodate and satisfy the needs & applications of the users.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Out of 30 users that took part in the survey, just 8 recorded their weights, and 23 recorded sleep events. the poor compliance can be attributed to;\n",
    "\n",
    "1. for weight-records, the manual inputs of weight values. To mitigate this, smart devices should be developed with a means for automated and flexible capture of the body-weights of its users for accurate and consistent data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. for sleep-events-records; the poor compliance observed can be attributed to the habit of users to charge their devices at bedtime.  \n",
    "Improvements in power \n",
    "and battery specifications can reduce such redundancies (e.g. Fast-Charge feature, longer-lasting batteries, etc.). \n",
    "  \n",
    "Programs targeted at empowering women with current information on Health & Wellness can be run via the Bellabeat App. Also information on how the various Bellabeat \n",
    "products can be utilized to achieve user's health & wellness goals can be provided on the app.  \n",

    "The Leaf product can be packaged to users based on its benefits of effectively tracking health status (e.g heart rate ) \n",
    "and showcasing problem areas where lifestyle modifications and medical interventions might be \n",
    "needed (e.g. where level of activity is poor, presented via low daily steps count).\n",
    "  \n",

    "The Bellabeat membership product can be designed to encourage referrals amongst peers with attractive incentives attached.\n",
